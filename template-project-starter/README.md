## VS Code Extensions

 We need the following extensions to facilitate the efficient Web Development

 | Extension  |  Purpose  | Remarks  |
 | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
 | Auto Rename Tag | To automatically make a change in the closing tags of HTML/XML while renaming an element/tag. |  None |
 | Bracket Pair Colorizer | To visually indicate the opening and closing pairs of the brackets, very useful when you have a nested brackets. | Author showed the Bracket pair colorizer, but I installed the `Bracket Pair Colorizer 2` which was listed and stated that improved and enhanced version. |
 | Live Server | To quickly check the developments on the HTML/CSS/JS files in effect without deploying it on a Web Server. It runs on a pseudo random server and port - 5500. | You might need a browser extension as well |
 | Prettier Code Formatter | To format the codes as you wish - example, `format on save` setting lets the code formatted automatically while saving the file etc., | Customize the options in the `settings.json` file |
 | Browser Extension | On my own - when you need to bring up the browser instance inside the VS Code without stepping out of the editor. | I did it on my own, but later disabled it as it was hindering with the `Live Server`. |
